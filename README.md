# Unity_Independent_Study_Portfolio
These are all the projects I did during my independent study, minus one which was unfortunately lost (there was a platforming/jump over hurdles games that was destroyed in favor of the final project). Project 3 is the final project, and final project is the prototype. Unfortunately the software was being mean and would not let me rename my files, sorry about that.
Despite that big paragraph, I am extremely happy with how this independent study went. I feel proud of what I learned and am excited to use my knowledge in the future!
